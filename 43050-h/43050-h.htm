<p>Once upon a time there lived, a great way off, an old man who had
two daughters, the name of the eldest was Fatima, the youngest Irene.
Irene was a very pretty girl, but Fatima was beauty itself; and so
very good besides, that every body loved her: you may see her
introduced to a gentleman, to whom she was going to be married, her
father having given his consent, had not the fame of her beauty
reached the ears of a very great man, I should have said tyrant, for
he was a very <span class="pagenum">[pg 6]</span>cruel over-bearing
nobleman, and had been married to several ladies, of whom nobody knew
what was become: but as he was very rich, and lived in a grand castle,
of which I here present you with the drawing; he some how or other,
was never long without a wife. This nobleman, whose name was
Abomelique, but generally called Blue Beard,
<span class="pagenum">[pg 7]</span>on account of his beard being of
that color, being determined to see her, under a pretence of business
paid the father of Fatima a visit. Poor Fatima! she little thought the
great Abomelique was come to her father's cottage on her account; but
so it was, he came attended like a king, (you may see him in the
picture) the father of Fatima standing at the door to receive him; as
soon as he <span class="pagenum">[pg 8]</span>entered the house the
old man entertained him in the best manner he could, and ordered his
two daughters to dress themselves in their best, and wait upon him;
who, being good girls, soon did as they were bid; no sooner did Blue
Beard see Fatima than he fell violently in love with her. I should not
say love, for it was that kind of love a wolf has for a pretty
innocent lamb; so <span class="pagenum">[pg 9]</span>without any more
ado, he told her father the reason of his coming, offering to make her
his wife; and that himself, and his other daughter, should go and live
with him at the Castle.</p>

</div>

<p>The father was quite delighted with the offer, especially as Blue
Beard told him he should be the master of all his slaves, and next
himself in power. Irene too tho't she should like it vastly; "what a
fine thing," said she to herself, "it will be to have fine rooms to
walk in when the weather is bad, and gardens to range in when the
weather is fine; well, I almost wish he had fallen in love with me,
for I don't think the great Abomelique would be so ugly, if it was not
for his monstrous <span class="pagenum">[pg 10]</span>great Blue
Beard;" Such was the thought of Irene. As to poor Fatima she fainted
away, which frightened Blue Beard, who would have been glad to have
found her agreeable to his wishes, however with much ado they brought
her to herself when Blue Beard left her, promising to come the next
day, and fetch her in state to the Castle: after he was gone nothing
ran in the father's head but how he should enjoy himself at the
Castle. As to Irene, she could not help pitying her sister, who was in
a sad taking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_012.jpg"><img src="images/th_012.jpg" width="400" height="294" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Fatima had a real love for Selim, to whom her father had promised
his consent in marriage. You see promises with some, like pye-crust,
is made to be broken. Ah! silly<span class="pagenum">[pg 11]</span>
old man, you little think about the evil that hangs over your
daughter's head. As Fatima knew she should be forced to go with Blue
Beard, she wrote immediately to Selim. Now only think what a fine
thing it is to be a scholar, for if Fatima could not have wrote to her
lover, nobody else would have done it for her, and what would have
been the consequence you will find by and by; so above all things
learn to read your book, that your daddy and mammy may learn you to
write too; well as soon as she had finished her letter, she gave it to
a trusty messenger, who set off full speed and soon arrived at Selim's
house. I must now return to Blue Beard, who could not get a wink of
sleep all <span class="pagenum">[pg 12]</span>night, so much did he
think of his intended bride: so, no sooner had the sun gilded the
mountain's tops than he was up, and the procession was ordered to move
towards the village; you can think what a fine sight it was, first
came two trumpeters, then two kettle-drums, then two French horns,
then two men with fine silken flags, then some of his black slaves
armed with bows <span class="pagenum">[pg 13]</span>and arrows; next
came the great Abomelique himself, riding on an elephant, under a fine
silken canopy; next followed another elephant richly dressed, with a
fine seat on his back, with a silken canopy over it, for Fatima and
her sister; a fine Arabian horse followed, led by a black slave, for
her father; a band of music following; then his slaves armed with bows
and arrows, closed the procession. Blue Beard brought some fine
clothes along with him for Fatima and her sister, which the father
insisted upon her wearing. It was in vain for her to tell him she
could not be happy, as her heart was given to Selim; he knew that Blue
Beard was very rich, and like many others, he thought happiness
<span class="pagenum">[pg 14]</span>consisted in wealth; so, says he,
have him you must, and have him you shall: Abomelique, at the same
time, took all manner of pains to please her; for, beside the fine
clothes, he brought her jewels and diamonds in profusion, and promised
she should want for nothing when she got to the castle.</p>

<p>After being dressed in a very grand manner she was put or rather
forced into her seat on the elephant's back along with her sister
Irene; the ladies round about, who came to the sight, could scarce
keep from envying her, forgetting that very fine clothes may hide a
very heavy heart, as it did now. No sooner was the company seated than
the music began to play, and off the great Abomelique
<span class="pagenum">[pg 15]</span>marched in triumph with his prize.
Her lover Selim no sooner received her letter, than knowing no time
was to be lost, went directly to his brother, who commanded a troop,
who promised to assist him to the utmost, so it was agreed to muster
their men, and to set off immediately for the father, and bring Fatima
away: or, if Blue Beard had already got her, to force her from him,
who by now had arrived at his Castle. Sure nothing could equal the
rejoicings made to welcome her.&mdash;Blue Beard conducted her to a fine
seat in a magnificent garden, where refreshments were placed and some
of the females were ordered to dance to entertain her; but for all
this she was still melancholy; as to her father
<span class="pagenum">[pg 16]</span>he was as merry as a grig, pulling
about the women, and driving about the men; and Irene would have been
merry could she have seen her sister so. Blue Beard having a mind to
leave her a little to herself, pretended he had business of the utmost
importance to transact, told her he must leave her till the evening,
giving her at the same time the keys of all the apartments of the
Castle, telling her, as she was mistress of the place to go freely
into any of them, except that room, the door of which was in the Blue
Chamber; and of which this key, set with diamonds, opens the lock;
upon your life don't go into that chamber, giving Fatima the keys; and
then with a look that frightened her sadly, left her; as
<span class="pagenum">[pg 17]</span>soon as he was gone, Irene cried,
'now is not that kind of him to give you the keys to go where you
please?' 'No, my dear sister,' said Fatima, 'I had much rather he had
kept them; you find I am forbid going into one room, did not you hear
him say, my life depended on it.'</p>

<p>'I don't think anything of that,' said Irene, I long to see that
chamber in particular; come don't mope so, if you had not seen Selim
first, you might be very happy, for setting aside his beard I don't
think Abomelique so very ugly; now as he won't be at home till
evening, pray do let us go over the Castle, I long to have a rummage.'
It was a long while before Irene could persuade her sister to go;
however she agreed <span class="pagenum">[pg 18]</span>at length, and
away they went; it would tire your patience if I told you all the fine
things they saw, in one of the rooms there was a fine guitar hanging
up, which Fatima took down, and began playing upon to divert her
melancholy.</p>

<p>Irene would not let her sister play upon it long, for she was
impatient to see the rest of the chambers, when at length they arrived
at the blue one, this was the grandest of all, it was lined with
looking glasses, ornamented with fine blue enamelled frames; here you
might see yourself from head to foot; the mantle piece was supported
by pillars of the finest blue china; and though it was called the Blue
Chamber, it might as well have<span class="pagenum">[pg 19]</span>
been called the Golden one as the floor was lined with it, two glass
chandeliers hung from the ceiling by chains of gold. In short, nothing
was wanting to make this the finest room that ever was seen: in the
middle of this chamber stood the door of that they were forbid to
enter: 'well, sister Fatima,' says Irene, 'I am quite delighted with
this place, I should like to see the next chamber vastly, I dare say
it must be finer still; come, what say you to it, shall we look at it?
there is nobody here to see us, and you know we need not tell of
ourselves.'</p>

<p>'Dear sister,' said Fatima, 'pray don't ask me, I dread the thought
of it, let us be satisfied with what we have seen, and return; indeed
<span class="pagenum">[pg 20]</span>I begin to be tired with the
ramble we have had;' 'well, my dear sister, said Irene, 'we may not
have such another opportunity a great while, if you wont go in, let us
just open the door, and only look in, sure there can be no great harm
in that.' 'I could like to please you,' says Fatima, 'but I am sadly
afraid;' 'Pho!' cried Irene, 'don't be afraid before you are hurt;
come, fear nothing.' Fatima, to please her, took the key all sparkling
with diamonds, and put it to the lock, when the door flew open in an
instant, and discovered such a dismal scene, that Fatima instantly
fainted away, the walls were lined with the skeletons, and the floor
was strewed with the limbs of the dead wives the cruel
<span class="pagenum">[pg 21]</span>Blue Beard had already murdered,
which were swimming in their blood, into which, when Fatima fainted,
she dropt the key. At one end of this dismal room stood the figure of
death holding a dart, and over him was wrote, in characters of blood,
<i>The punishment of curiosity</i>. 'Mercy on me!' said Fatima, as
soon as she recovered, 'what will become of me. Abomelique will surely
find me out, and no doubt serve me as he has done the poor creatures
we have just seen.'</p>

<p>'Come, dear sister,' said Irene, 'let us get away, I am very sorry
I persuaded you to open the door;'&mdash;'Where is the key gone,' says
Fatima, ''tis not in the door?' 'Perhaps it is dropt,' says Irene; and
so it <span class="pagenum">[pg 22]</span>was sure enough, and what
was worse, into the blood: she took it up, locked the door, and wiped
the blood from off her hands, but in spite of all they could do, they
could not wipe it from the key. Now you must know this key was the
gift of a fairy to Blue Beard; and when poor Fatima found she could
not clean it, she cried bitterly, and Irene could not help crying too.
'You know, my dear, 'tis a saying, one trouble seldom comes alone;'
and that was the case now; for while they were thinking what they
should do, a black slave entered to tell them Abomelique was returned,
and expected them in the grand saloon. This was terrible news for
Fatima, who <span class="pagenum">[pg 23]</span>gave herself up for
lost; however, go she must.</p>

<p>'Now as they were going,' Fatima says to Irene, 'my dear sister,
yesterday I wrote to Selim, and as I make no doubt but he received the
letter, this day I hoped to see him; pray do you go to the top of the
tower, and if he should be coming, beckon him with your handkerchief
to make haste.' Away went Irene with a heavy heart; while Fatima, with
a heavier one, went to meet Blue Beard; who, as soon as he saw her,
cried out, 'Well Madam, how have you entertained yourself? don't you
think there are sights in the Castle worth looking at?' 'Yes,' replied
Fatima, sighing, 'there are indeed!'&mdash;'But why
<span class="pagenum">[pg 24]</span>sigh, my love!' says Blue Beard,
'I hope you have not broke the order I gave you; come, give me the
keys.' Poor Fatima with an aching heart, put her hand into her pocket,
and pulling out the keys, gave them to him with a trembling hand.</p>

<p>Blue Beard was afraid something had happened by her trembling; he
no sooner saw the blood on the key of the chamber he forbid her to
enter, than his countenance changed, and he roared out in a voice like
thunder, 'Ah! wretch, I see what you have been at; you have seen my
former wives, who have forfeited their lives by their curiosity, and
you shall now go and lay among them.'</p>

<span class="pagenum">[pg 25]</span>

<p>So saying he seized her by the hair of her head: when, falling on
her knees, she besought him to spare her life; but he was a monster
not to be moved. When she found he was determined to kill her, she
begged him to grant her a little time to say her prayers. He bid her
go, but not be long or he would fetch her.</p>

<p>Getting up into her chamber, she called for her sister, and asked
her if she saw any thing. 'No, dear sister,' said Irene, 'nothing but
the dreary common and the sky.' 'Are you most done?' said Blue Beard;
'yes,' cried Fatima; when calling again to Irene, she said, 'sister,
what do you see?' 'Nothing, dear sister, but a flock of sheep.'
<span class="pagenum">[pg 26]</span>'Are you not a coming?' said
Blue Beard, in a surlier voice than before; 'yes directly,' said
Fatima; when calling to her sister, she asked her if she saw nothing?
'yes,' cried Irene, 'I see a great cloud of dust, but it is a great
way off.' 'If you don't come down,' Blue Beard roared out, 'I will
fetch you;' 'coming,' cried Fatima: when calling again to her sister,
she asked her what she saw? 'I see,' cried Irene, 'a number of
horsemen riding full speed towards the Castle;' 'wave your
handkerchief, dear sister, that they may make more haste, or I fear it
will be all over with me.'</p>

<p>At this instant entered Blue Beard, and seizing her hair, began
dragging her towards the Blue <span class="pagenum">[pg 27]</span>
Chamber, while her shrieks were enough to pierce the heart of stone.
He had not dragged her far before he heard the sound of feet on the
stairs and as tyrants are always cowards, he stopt to listen.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_027.jpg"><img src="images/th_027.jpg" width="400" height="366" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He had not stopt long before Selim, (who had forced into the
Castle) following the cries of Fatima, rushed into the room, with his
<span class="pagenum">[pg 28]</span>sword in hand. 'Villain,' said
Blue Beard, drawing his scymater, 'what dost thou here?' 'Tyrant,'
cried Selim, 'to punish such a monster as thou art.' They said no
more, but at it they went. Despair lent courage to Blue Beard; love to
Selim; while poor Fatima sat trembling on the floor. At length Selim
prevailed: for running Blue Beard through the body, he laid him
breathless on the floor.</p>

<p>He now went to Fatima, who was fainting, and taking her in his
arms, carried her to the window to give her air.</p>

<p>In the mean time his brother had overcome the slaves, who were not
sorry to hear of Blue Beard's death.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 29]</span>

<p>Selim took possession of the Castle, gave the slaves their liberty,
and married Fatima. Selim's brother fell in love with and married
Irene, and they all lived together happily.</p>
<span class="pagenum">[pg 30]</span>

<div class="poem">
<p>Cruel Blue Beard being dead</p>
<p>And those lovers in his stead,</p>
<p>Time goes merrily along,</p>
<p>Now a dance, and then a song:</p>
<p>for whenever true love's found,</p>
<p>Joy and pleasure will abound.</p>
<p>By the poor around they're blest,</p>
<p>By the rich around carest;</p>
<p>Guilt may leave behind its stings,</p>
<p>Nought but comfort virtue brings.</p>
